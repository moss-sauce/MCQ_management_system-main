Abid Message for you


Data is loaded into the database some entity question_tag,quiz_question(bridge  entity) missing

Backend is loading data but somehow frontend is not loading it.
Here I tried to show all questions with options
Backend loaded all but frontend couldn't

remember 




to load data in database 
create a database named quiz_platform and MCQ_Management_System as Network Name
then simply run schema.sql then seed.sql
if any problem run delete_Reset.sql and then schema and seed 


to Load Backend -> node index.js in server terminal


to Load frontend ->npm run dev in client terminal

You may try to solve the problem of frontend try  not to mess with other as much as possible
but do it .You can do it.
